## CO₂ Capture & Sequestration Simulator<br>

****Introduction****<br>

Carbon dioxide (CO₂) is the major greenhouse gas responsible for global warming and climate change. The growing concern over CO₂ emissions from industrial and energy production sources has led to the development of Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) technologies. This virtual lab focuses on simulating CCS processes to understand their components, mechanisms, and effectiveness using computational tools.<br>

****What is CCS?****<br>

Carbon Capture and Sequestration (CCS) is a three-step process:

1. Capture: Separation of CO₂ from flue gases or industrial streams.

2. Transport: Movement of captured CO₂ via pipelines, ships, or trucks to a storage location.

3.  Sequestration (Storage): Long-term storage of CO₂ in underground geological formations such as deep saline aquifers, depleted oil/gas fields, or unmineable coal seams.<br>

****CO₂ Capture Techniques****
1. Post-combustion capture: CO₂ is removed after fossil fuel combustion.

2. Pre-combustion capture: CO₂ is captured before combustion by gasifying the fuel.

3. Oxy-fuel combustion: Uses pure oxygen for combustion, producing a CO₂-rich flue gas.

4. Emerging technologies: Chemical looping, membrane separation, adsorption, and cryogenic separation.<br>

****CO₂ Sequestration****<br>

Geological formations used for sequestration must have:<br>

1. High porosity and permeability (for CO₂ injection).

2. An impermeable caprock to prevent leakage.

3. Long-term geochemical stability.<br>

Saline aquifers are among the most commonly used due to their vast capacity and widespread availability.
