        "a": "Cryogenic distillation",

        "c": "Adsorption",
        "d": "All of the above"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Cryogenic separation is one approach to CO₂ capture.",
        "b": "Chemical looping is a valid combustion-based capture method.",
        "c": "Adsorption uses solid materials to capture CO₂.",
        "d": "Correct. All listed methods are used in CO₂ capture."

      "question": "Which phase of CCS involves transporting CO₂ to a storage site?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Capture",
        "b": "Compression",
        "c": "Transport",
        "d": "Sequestration"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Capture is the initial phase where CO₂ is separated from emissions.",
        "b": "Compression prepares CO₂ for transport, but doesn't move it.",
        "c": "Correct. Transport involves moving CO₂ to a storage site.",
        "d": "Sequestration is the final phase where CO₂ is stored."

      "question": "Which of the following is the most commonly used solvent in post-combustion CO₂ capture?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Ammonia",
        "b": "Monoethanolamine (MEA)",
        "c": "Sodium hydroxide",
        "d": "Methanol"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ammonia can be used, but it is not the most common.",
        "b": "Correct. MEA is widely used due to its high CO₂ reactivity.",
        "c": "Sodium hydroxide is used in other chemical processes, not typically CCS.",
        "d": "Methanol is not used in standard CO₂ capture systems."

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Ocean trenches are not suitable or secure for CO₂ storage.",
        "b": "Correct. Deep saline aquifers are widely used for long-term storage.",
        "c": "Mountaintop reservoirs are not used for CCS.",
        "d": "Arctic permafrost is unstable for long-term storage."

      "question": "The main environmental goal of CO₂ capture and sequestration is to:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Improve fuel efficiency",
        "b": "Reduce greenhouse gas emissions",
        "c": "Increase oil recovery",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Fuel efficiency may improve indirectly but is not the main goal.",
        "b": "Correct. CCS is primarily aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions.",
        "c": "Enhanced oil recovery is a possible benefit, not the main goal.",
        "d": "Water production is not a function of CCS."
