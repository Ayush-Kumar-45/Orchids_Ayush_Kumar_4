    {
      "question": "What is the primary purpose of CO₂ capture and sequestration (CCS)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Increase fossil fuel usage",
        "b": "Reduce global temperatures immediately",
        "c": "Minimize CO₂ emissions from industrial sources",
        "d": "Produce more carbon for energy generation"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Increasing fossil fuel usage would worsen CO₂ emissions.",
        "b": "Incorrect. CCS helps reduce emissions but does not instantly affect global temperatures.",
        "c": "Correct. The main aim of CCS is to minimize CO₂ emissions from industrial sources.",
        "d": "Incorrect. CCS does not produce carbon; it stores it safely."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which of the following is a commonly used simulation tool for modeling CCS systems?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "AutoCAD",
        "b": "MATLAB/Simulink",
        "c": "Aspen Plus",
        "d": "MS Word"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. AutoCAD is mainly used for drafting and design.",
        "b": "Incorrect. MATLAB is useful but not specifically for CCS process modeling.",
        "c": "Correct. Aspen Plus is widely used for process modeling in CCS.",
        "d": "Incorrect. MS Word is a word processor, not a simulation tool."

      "question": "In post-combustion CO₂ capture, CO₂ is removed:",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Before fuel is burned",
        "b": "After combustion of the fuel",
        "c": "During the fuel refining stage",
        "d": "While mining the fuel"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Pre-combustion methods remove CO₂ before burning.",
        "b": "Correct. Post-combustion capture occurs after fuel is burned.",
        "c": "Incorrect. CO₂ capture does not usually occur during refining.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Mining is not part of the CO₂ capture process."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "What is a key risk associated with geological CO₂ sequestration?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "CO₂ converting to oxygen",
        "b": "Earthquake generation",
        "c": "Leakage of CO₂ back to the atmosphere",
        "d": "Production of fossil fuels"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. CO₂ does not convert to oxygen underground.",
        "b": "Partially correct, but not as common as leakage risks.",
        "c": "Correct. Leakage is a major concern in geological sequestration.",
        "d": "Incorrect. CO₂ storage does not produce fossil fuels."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "difficulty": "intermediate"

    {
      "question": "Which of the following formations is most suitable for long-term CO₂ storage?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Riverbeds",
        "b": "Saline aquifers",
        "c": "Forest soils",
        "d": "Volcano chambers"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Riverbeds are not secure for CO₂ storage.",
        "b": "Correct. Saline aquifers are widely used and suitable for long-term storage.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Forest soils are not viable for deep geological storage.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Volcano chambers are unstable and unsuitable."
